# Merp - MÃ¥rten's Extraordinary Regex Printer
Traverses the file system and prints lines matching an input pattern - sort of like grep. But it's not grep. It's merp. We love merp, Merp is awesome. Merp is not finished. (We love grep to).

## Why should I use merp instead of grep?
You shouldn't. Merp is a small personal project. But if you really want a reason, how about speed. Merp is multithreaded. Merp is the best!

## Can't I simply use `parallell`?
No - use merp!

## But...
No! Merp is the best. Merp knows the way (to the matching pattern). We trust merp with our files!

# TODO:
+ Add argument parsing for number of threads and make program use them.
+ Ignore files that can't be opened, instead of breaking execution.
